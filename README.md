<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

The following button is the result of the development of the Button component challenge from devChallenges. the challenge consisted in developing a reusable Button that follows the following user stories.

The page can be viewed at the following [link](https://buttoncomponentdev.web.app/). If you liked the project, give me a star ‚≠ê.

The project enabled me to set aside my prior knowledge of React and to broaden my understanding of the library and its functions. While the initial challenge was to reacquaint myself with the framework, as I began programming, everything flowed smoothly until each user story was completed.

Furthermore, the project allowed me to learn about Storybook, a powerful tool, its functionalities, and potential use cases. This tool is valuable because it facilitates testing of each component developed in the project and identifies its respective properties.

Overall, I was able to enhance my technology stack with useful tools for the workplace, and I strengthened my foundational skills in development, such as the pillars of HTML, CSS, and JS, as well as implementing best practices and methodologies, such as BEM, that promote organization.

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/ohgVTyJCbm5OZyTB2gNY) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

- User story: I can see different button types: default, outline and text
- User story: I can choose to disable box-shadow
- User story: I can choose to disable the button
- User story: I can choose to have an icon on the left or right (Use Google Icon)
- User story: I can have different button sizes
- User story: I can have different colors
- User story: When I hover or focus, I can see visual indicators
- User story: I can still access all button attributes
- User story (optional): Show button in a similar way like the design or use Storybook. Otherwise, showing the button in multiple states is enough
