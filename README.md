<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

The project consists in the creation of my own portfolio to show all the projects developed to complete the challenges of devchallenges or personal projects. [The original design](https://www.figma.com/file/O7Omgz2iVR7Vox7shf7O8e?chrome=DOCUMENTATION&embed_host=astra&kind=&node-id=0%3A1&viewer=1) was provided by Devchallenges in the challenge.

The page can be viewed at the following [link](https://andresfuentesmartinez-e887a.firebaseapp.com/). If you liked the project, give me a star ‚≠ê.

In the development of the project, initially I wanted to learn a technology that would allow me to automate the generation of the build folder and all the files it contains for the page to work, as technology I chose Gulp because it is simple to implement and is useful for small projects. I also wanted to improve my way of naming all my HTML classes, and I opted for the BEM methodology, this helped me a lot to improve the organization of my CSS code, to the point of being more maintainable.

As for the functionality of the portfolio, I used the getElementBy method, in order to improve my JS skills without libraries.

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/ohgVTyJCbm5OZyTB2gNY) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

- User story: I can see different button types: default, outline and text
- User story: I can choose to disable box-shadow
- User story: I can choose to disable the button
- User story: I can choose to have an icon on the left or right (Use Google Icon)
- User story: I can have different button sizes
- User story: I can have different colors
- User story: When I hover or focus, I can see visual indicators
- User story: I can still access all button attributes
- User story (optional): Show button in a similar way like the design or use Storybook. Otherwise, showing the button in multiple states is enough
